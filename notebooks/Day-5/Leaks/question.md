## Total Runtime Summary

**Minimum Time**: 20-50 minutes (basic analysis only)
**Typical Time**: 2-8 hours (full pipeline)  
**Maximum Time**: 4-12 hours (all ensembles)
**Current Progress**: 4/10 properties completed (40%)
**Estimated Remaining Time**: 12-18 hours

**Breakdown by remaining properties:**
- BlendProperty4: ~1-2 hours to complete
- BlendProperties 5-10: ~2-3 hours each

**Total Estimated Runtime**: 27-33 hours (started at 02:31, likely completing around 05:31-11:31 tomorrow)

**Performance Notes**: The Gaussian Process models are taking the longest (3-5 minutes per test), while simpler models complete in seconds. Neural network tests are consistently failing but don't significantly impact runtime.

**Expected Output**: The pipeline will generate approximately 60-120 .csv files depending on model configurations and ensemble combinations.
